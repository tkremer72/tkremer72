- 👋 Hi, I’m @tkremer72
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can about software development in JavaScript.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create simple games using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, the Grid system and some Bootstrap.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source code that will benefit others on a quest to learn more such as myself. 
- 📫 How to reach me tkremer@nc.rr.com
